Explain basic operations: load and store.

Explain different refresh modes: Burst refresh vs distributed refresh and RAS-only refresh vs CAS before RAS refresh.

Trends - Storage array rectangular
            cant go wider (word lines length = timing = power)
            gets taller = more refreshes
            over time .... projektions (see Intel)
