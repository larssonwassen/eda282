RIO is a technique proposed by Seungjae Baek et al. \cite{rioparis} in which they identify cells with low retention time (bad cells) and `deletes' them. This is done by changing the memory allocating modules in the OS to not allocate pages that have bad cells in them. They implement RIO in a Linux kernel which is run and tested on a real hardware system and is able to achieve 87.5\% reduction in refresh count with a performance increas of 4.5\% on average. As the implementaion only relies on changes in the kernel and there is no need to modify the hardware this technique would be easy to adopt in systems today. To keep fragmentation of the memory low a maximum of 0.1\% of total memory pages gets `deleted'. Even though deletion of a larger amount of pages could decrease the amount of refreshes further it would cause trouble for the kernel which relies on being able to allocate large contiguous address spaces.

Seungjae Baek et al. also propose PARIS discussed in \ref{sec:val} which can be combined with RIO for further improvments.
