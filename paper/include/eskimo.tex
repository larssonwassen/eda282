VALIDITY.
\todo[inline]{Ccopy-paste:}
We propose ESKIMO , a scheme where when the program or operating systems memory manager all ocates or
frees up a memory region, this information is used by the architecture to optimize the working of the DRAM system, particularly to save energy and power. In this work we attempt to have the architecture work hand in hand with inform ation about allocated and freed space provided by the program.
