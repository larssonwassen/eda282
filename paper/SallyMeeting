INTRO
  energy is an inc. system design constraint
  man mem consumes a groving portion of system power and this will continue to increase (details & refs in background)
  most mani memories include dram
  two ssources of powerconsumption in DRAM static/dynamic (blahah/driving data)
  static leakage
  DRAM refresh ops account for a groing portion of dynamic power, yet they perform no usefiul accesses (from cpu perspective)
  finding ways to reduce power spent on frefresh is a straightfroward way to mitigate DRAM power

{Whats the problem?
 WHy is it important?
 What is the shape of the solution?
 Why will it work? (dont go intol detail, this is a survey paper)
 }

BACKGROUND
  DRAM explination w/ pic.
  basic op
  refresh modes? (options)
  trends - Storage array rectangular
            cant go wider (word lines length -> timing -> power)
            gets taller -> more refreshes
            over time .... projektions

REDUCING REFRESH POWER
  roadmap - (Worth mentioning scheduling real acces togheter with refresh ops)
            vs. trying to ID unnecessary or deferable refreshes
  We focus on second!
  1. types of refreshing
  2. paragraph per approach/sets of apporaches wrt infon in 1.
