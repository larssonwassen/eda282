\todo[inline]{Introduction, one paragraph}

\subsection{Task 1}
\todo[inline]{Analyze the source code of the benchmark and provide a detailed description of how it works. Comment on the prominent communication patterns in the benchmark.}

\subsection{Task 2}
\todo[inline]{Explain our parallel version}

\subsection{Task 3}
\todo[inline]{
Evaluate MSI, MESI, and MESI+migratory in the context of this benchmark. Perform a detailed characterization of the benchmark using different protocols. Discuss how the behavior changes when the working set size is modified. Show how execution time relates to the cache access statistics.}


\subsection{Task 4}
\todo[inline]{
Outline a strategy to modify the MESI protocol to support the O state.
Analyze the MESI\_SMPCache.cpp source to understand how the MESI protocol is currently modeled.
Discuss changes that need to be made to the readLine, writeLine, readRemoteAction, and writeRemoteAction functions. Show the necessary changes in pseudocode. Should the code that tracks cache access statistics be modified? If so, how?}
