\subsection{Task 2}
\todo[inline]{
Compare MSI and MESI.
When is having the E state beneficial (over baseline MSI)?
How does the behavior change when the dataset size changes?}



\subsection{Task 3}
\todo[inline]{
Compare MESI and MESI+migratory.
Why is one better than the other?
How does the behavior change when the dataset size changes?}
